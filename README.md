## Usage
The user will be presented with 5 questions.  Each question is worth 10 points.  The initial start timer gives the user 75 seconds to answer.  However, if an answer is selected as wrong, then the user will lose 15 seconds.  If the timer reaches 0 before the 5 questions are answered, then the quiz will end and the user will be presented with their points.
